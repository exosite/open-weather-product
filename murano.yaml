    To add a weather location, add a device with matching identity id under the `Devices` panel.
    You can provide the location as one of the following:
      - `<zip code>,<COUNTRY-CODE>` eg. `20455,TW`
      - `<longitude>,<latitude>` eg. `12.4,32.1`
      - `<City name>` eg. `Taipei`
    Each configured locations will behave as a device emitting weather data every hours.
    You can force the update by going to the `Services -> Openweatherapi` and clicking `Apply` (no need of changing any value).

    You can modify the incoming payload data by updating the `vendor.c2c.transform` module.
    NOTE: for ExoSense compatibility, you should then also change the `vendor.c2c.transform` accordingly.
