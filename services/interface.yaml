  http://openweathermap.org Cloud-Connector providing weather data to your application.
  To add a new location, add a device using. `addIdentity({ identity = identity })`.

  The `identity` support the following formats:
  - `<zip code>,<COUNTRY-CODE>` eg. `20455,TW`
  - `<latitude>,<longitude>` eg. `12.4,32.1`
  - `<City name>` eg. `Taipei`

            When set the query returns 'limit' number of devices but skip
            'offset' number of devices at the beginning. This is useful in
            combination with the 'before' field when more than 'limit' of
            identities "lastseen" are all the same.
        order:
          description: |-
            Sort identities by attribute values. Use '.desc' postfix to indicate descending order.
            You also can order by specific resources state value reported by the identity, with 'state.resource_name'.

        status:

            Restrict devices to only those with provided statuses.
            The following states are recognized:
            * a "locked" identity may not connect, even with valid authentication
            * a "reprovision" status indicates the device must reprovision because
              its authentication key has expired
            * an "expired" status indicates that the identity provisioning window
              has expired and must be reset.
            * a "provisioned" identity has associated authentication credentials
            * a "whitelisted" identity does not have authentication credentials
              associated and must be provisioned
            * a "devmode" status indicates that the device that has authenticated
              over a non secure (unencrypted) transport.  Its credentials have
              been flagged and are no longer considered secure.
        identity:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Returns only device identities that matches given regex.
            To restrict the list to only those devices beginning with the letter
            "a", for example, use the following regular expression: "^a.*".
